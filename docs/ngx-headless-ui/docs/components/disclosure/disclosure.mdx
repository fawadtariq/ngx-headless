# Disclosure

The `Disclosure` component is a fully headless and accessible UI primitive that enables toggling content visibility. It's inspired by [HeadlessUI Disclosure](https://headlessui.com/v1/vue/disclosure), but built natively for Angular.

It is useful for building collapsible panels, accordions, and FAQs ‚Äî while giving you complete control over markup and styling.

## When to use it
Use `Disclosure` when you need a toggleable UI component that is:

- Fully customizable in layout and appearance
- Accessible with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Controlled via Angular `templateRefs` or `Dependency Injection (DI)`
- Compatible with reactive or template-driven forms

Common use cases:

- Collapsible panels
- Accordions
- FAQs

## Anatomy

A complete `Disclosure` is composed of three components:

- **`Disclosure`** - The provider and wrapper. Manages internal open/close state.
- **`DisclosureButton`** - The trigger that toggles the panel open or closed.
- **`DisclosurePanel`** - The container for content that is shown or hidden.

All three components are standalone and composable.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Accessible by default (ARIA attributes)
- ‚úÖ Tailwind-friendly (no styles imposed)
- ‚úÖ Multiple selectors supported:
  - `<Disclosure>`
  - `<div ngxDisclosure>`
  - `<ngx-headlessui-disclosure>`
- ‚úÖ Works with both `#templateRefs` and Angular DI (`DisclosureContextService`)
- ‚úÖ Supports multiple instances per page


## Installation

`Disclosure` ships as part of the `@ngx-headless/ui` by default. Install if you haven't already.

```bash
npm install @ngx-headless/ui
```
Import the components directly:

```ts
import {
  DisclosureComponent,
  DisclosureButtonComponent,
  DisclosurePanelComponent,
} from "@ngx-headless/ui";
```

## Usage Examples

### Template Reference ‚Äî Single Disclosure

```html
<Disclosure #d="ngxDisclosure">
  <DisclosureButton [class.active]="d.isOpen()">Toggle</DisclosureButton>
  <DisclosurePanel *ngIf="d.isOpen()">Panel content</DisclosurePanel>
</Disclosure>
```

### Template Reference ‚Äî Multiple Disclosures (ngFor)

```html
<Disclosure *ngFor="let faq of faqs" #d="ngxDisclosure">
  <DisclosureButton>{{ faq.question }}</DisclosureButton>
  <DisclosurePanel *ngIf="d.isOpen()">{{ faq.answer }}</DisclosurePanel>
</Disclosure>
```

Access all instances in the component in your class Root:

```ts
...
export class MyComponent {
  ...

@ViewChildren('d') disclosures!: QueryList<DisclosureComponent>;
// ‚òùÔ∏è access to All Disclosures via #templateRefs

// üß† NOTE: You can also use @ViewChild with DisclosureComponent without QueryList<> to capture a single instance

  ...
}
```

---

### Dependency Injection ‚Äî Single Disclosure (Advanced Usage)

In cases where you want to encapsulate toggle logic or access open state inside a child component, you can inject DisclosureContextService.

This is especially useful for buttons, status indicators, or nested logic inside a single Disclosure.

Here's an example:
Add a custom component anywhere inside the `<Disclosure>` wrapper:

```html
<Disclosure>
  ...
  <MyChildComponent></MyChildComponent>
  ...
</Disclosure>
```

Inject DisclosureContextService into the constructor of your component. You can then access and control the disclosure state programmatically.

```ts
import { DisclosureContextService } from '@ngx-headless/ui';

...

export class MyChildComponent {
  constructor(public disclosure: DisclosureContextService) {}

  ...

  disclosure.isOpen();
  disclosure.toggle();
  disclosure.close();
  disclosure.open();

}
```

> üß† Note: This works only inside a single `<Disclosure>` context. Injection **is not valid** for tracking multiple disclosures.

## Accessibility

This component handles

- `aria-expanded` on the `DisclosureButton`
- `aria-controls` on the `DisclosureButton` (if linked to DisclosurePanel)
- `id` and `aria-labelledby` linkage between button and panel (optional but supported)
- Keyboard interaction (customizable): toggle on Enter / Space
- tabindex and focus ring behaviors handled by browser natively
- Screen reader compatibility for collapsed/expanded state

Note: The component is fully headless ‚Äî all accessibility behaviors are opt-in or behavior-driven without imposing any DOM structure. You are responsible for adding aria-controls, id, and keyboard bindings if needed.

## Animations

`DisclosurePanel` can be animated freely using Angular‚Äôs built-in animation system.

Angular supports entry/exit transitions using `@trigger` bindings and the `:enter`/`:leave` lifecycle hooks.

üëâ [See Angular Animations Guide](https://angular.dev/guide/animations)

### Example

Add an animation trigger to your component:

```ts
import { trigger, transition, style, animate } from "@angular/animations";

@Component({
  animations: [
    trigger("slideToggle", [
      transition(":enter", [
        style({ height: 0, opacity: 0 }),
        animate("200ms ease-out", style({ height: "*", opacity: 1 })),
      ]),
      transition(":leave", [
        animate("150ms ease-in", style({ height: 0, opacity: 0 })),
      ]),
    ]),
  ],
})
export class ExampleComponent {}
```

Use it in the template with `*ngIf`:

```html
<DisclosurePanel *ngIf="disclosure.isOpen()" @slideToggle>
  Panel content goes here.
</DisclosurePanel>
```

‚úÖ You now have full control over the entrance and exit behavior of the panel.  
You can combine this with `Tailwind` transitions or any styling framework as needed.

| Pattern                         | Supports Multiple?   | Central Control?      | Use Case                              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `#templateRef`                  | ‚úÖ Yes               | ‚úÖ via `ViewChildren` | Recommended for most use cases        |
| `DisclosureContextService` (DI) | ‚úÖ Per-instance only | ‚ùå No                 | Use inside isolated nested components |
